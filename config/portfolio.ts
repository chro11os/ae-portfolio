    bioP1: "Art has been meaningful to me from the very beginning. It became a way for me to express my own feelings, and with the right knowledge and understanding, to communicate ideas that others could also connect with. Art carries multiple meanings and interpretations, and in that way, it has the power to reach, help, and move people.",
    bioP2: "As I continue my journey as a college student, I have come to realize that art can be more than personal expression. One of the things that continually reignites my passion – especially during moments of exhaustion or near burnout – is learning the true purpose of a designer and a media practitioner. With this role comes responsibility: to create not only for oneself, but for the people who will experience and use the work.",
    bioP3: "A key lesson I will always carry with me is the Design Thinking process. It taught me to approach design with empathy, intention, and problem-solving at its core. This mindset reshaped how I view creativity – not just as making something visually appealing, but as designing with purpose, clarity, and impact.",

My only experience came from doodling with pen and paper during class breaks and in quiet moments of free time. Entering a space filled with classmates who had years of training, workshops, tutors, and industry exposure was intimidating. Instead of discouraging me, it became my motivation. I knew I had to catch up – and all I had was my passion, discipline, and the drive to become better. These works represent my starting point as an inexperienced but deeply committed first-year student, learning through experimentation and persistence.",

With the right lens and angle, even the most ordinary things can take on a meaningful quality. Photography has shown me that what people often pass by or choose to ignore can hold quiet stories, emotions, and depth – waiting to be seen.",

Utilizing a design thinking framework and empathy interviews with five educators from Philippine universities, the research identifies key themes regarding pedagogical strategies, academic integrity, and the enduring necessity of human-centric critical thinking. The findings offer practical implications for curriculum development and policy formation to ensure students leverage AI as a collaborative tool rather than a substitute for creativity.",
